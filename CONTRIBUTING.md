First of all, many thanks for being willing to contribute!

If you'd like to update an action or modify it slightly, you can just [open an issue](https://github.com/hherebus/tasker-toggl/issues/new) or submit a pull request.

There is only one thing I take as a "requirement", which is to make the change friendly to end-users where possible. If, for instance, you modify a Javascriptlet to use a new variable that the user has to set, please also add a "Set Variable" action to the task, so that it will be clear to the end-user that they can set it, without them having to look through the Javascriptlet's code. Other nice things to do are making sure that names are short (long names are a pain in Tasker on mobile), and that tasks mirror endpoints in the Toggl API as closely as possible, where appropriate.

Cheers!
