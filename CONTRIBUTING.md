Thank you for wanting to contribute!

If you'd like to update an action or modify it sligthly, you can just [open an issue](https://github.com/hherebus/tasker-toggl/issues/new) or submit a pull request.

There is only one thing I take as a requirement, which is to make the change friendly to end-users where possible.

Cheers!
